#+BEGIN_NOTES
Helo everyone.
Welcome to the HiDALGO workshop.
In its introductory talk I will briefly introduce you to the HiDALGO project and its services.

Global challenges gain a solid attention from the society.
They are broadly discussed in the media.

Almost daily we hear about wars, pandemics, climate change and other troubles 
from the TV, newspapers, Twitter, FB and so on.
We even have Netflix documentaries about global challenges -- 
the Netflix which usually should entertain us.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
HiDALGO project was established in order to address this solid demand in the society
to know more about global challenges and how to deal with them efficiently.
We are an EU funded project which brings together GSS and HPC experts
from 13 partner institutions out of 7 countries.
The work is coordinated by ATOS Spain and we are in the 3rd year of the project.

For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than from eating too little;
more people die from old age than from infectious diseases;
and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Some thinkers tend to reason that famine, plagues, and wars are essentially problems of the former centuries
and humanity must look on the challenges of the like future happiness, immortality or God-like powers.
In HiDALGO we have a more conservative view.
If we take a look on the news that dominate in the media over the last months,
we will see pandemics and wars, besides other topics.
So these constitute use cases for our research.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
HiDALGO approaches policy-making via accurate digital twinning of GCs. 
Accurate digital twins for GCs inevitably
involve models for diverse social and physical phenomena
and consume massive sets of static and streaming data.
The generalized HiDALGO workflow is demonstrated on this slide.
Such simulation-centric approach gives rise to a number of research topics related to 
coupling of models and data sources -- including coupling across data centers --
and to design of HPDA methods.

[[./figs/tools/hidalgo-tools.png]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
In order to implement this approach, we use, develop, and promote a bunch of software tools.
You can see some on them listed on this slide.
In the domain of simulation we use ABMS and CFD frameworks,
as well as specific linear algebra packages,
some of which are developed by our researchers.
In the domain of DA, we primarily rely on the well established frameworks like Dask and Spark.
For visualization, we use our developments -- Covise and Visualizer --
capable of tackling massive datasets and providing immersive visualization features.
Finally, for orchestrating complicated coupled simulation workflows, we use tools like Cloudify and FabSim.
